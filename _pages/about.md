I am pursuing a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at Addis Ababa University, building upon my undergraduate foundation in Software Engineering from Wolkite University, completed in 2021. 

My research is currently focused on addressing gender bias in machine translation systems. I am particularly interested in leveraging deep learning to develop practical AI solutions for real-world challenges. Additionally, I am also intrigued by the potential of generative AI and its rapidly evolving capabilities.

Outside of academia, I enjoy reading📖, playing basketball🏀, and spending time with loved ones.
